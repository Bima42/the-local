The bartenders are super friendly and really take the time to explain the idea behind each cocktail, which makes it even more fun.

The price of the cocktails are fair, the quality is not the best but according to the price. i liked that even the more deluxe cocktails were the same price happy hour price (8euros).\nThere is not that much space but if you go early, you can find place. There is bathroom and is clean but there is a nice lady on the entrance where you can tip her. I felt guilty everytime because i didnt have coins or cash, just 50 cents. The music is normal generic music, from time to time they put latin music but really selten. There is a TV where they put the fotos of the people that went there, and what i liked a lot is that from time to time there were facts or general information about beverages/cocktails. It was cool",

The bartenders clearly know their craft, and the quality of ingredients shines through in every sip.\n\nThe atmosphere is another highlight: stylish, vibrant, and with a unique character that sets it apart from the usual bar scene. It’s a place that invites you to stay a little longer, enjoy the mood, and discover new favorites from the menu.\n\nA solid 4-star experience—excellent drinks and an engaging ambiance.
