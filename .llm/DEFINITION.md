# Google Maps AI Agent

## Overview
A rapid prototype developed for a hackathon that transforms how users discover and filter places using natural language queries and intelligent review analysis.

## Problem
Current Google Maps experience lacks personalization and makes it difficult to find exactly what you're looking for:
- Generic, one-size-fits-all results
- Time-consuming manual review checking and comparison
- No intelligent filtering based on specific user needs
- Limited context-aware recommendations

## Solution
An AI-powered agent that processes natural language queries and intelligently filters Google Places data:
- **Natural language interface** - Ask questions conversationally, no chat UI needed
- **Smart review analysis** - Automatically filters and analyzes reviews based on your criteria
- **Keyword extraction** - Surfaces relevant information with key highlights
- **Context-aware results** - Considers all place characteristics to match your specific needs

## Technical Approach
Leveraging Google Places API (Text Search + Place Details) to access comprehensive location data and metadata, combined with AI to provide intelligent filtering and personalized recommendations.

## Goal
Deliver a fast, immersive experience that saves time by understanding user intent and presenting exactly what they need with clear explanations.
