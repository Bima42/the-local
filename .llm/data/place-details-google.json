          "text": "In my opinion Google Maps is not a reliable source for information about a business. Here is my reasoning.  I tried to get a false review removed and then not hearing back for weeks I tried appealing using the tools provided just to get a denial with no explanation except it doesn’t violate the guidelines but in reality the false review obviously did as I pointed out using the information from the guidelines.  It is disheartening and it is  disappointing that Google does not adhere to the guidelines they've established. At this point, my trust in Google's reliability has diminished. It's unsettling that such an apparent discrepancy like this is not being removed when it clearly should be, exists. They say that they take it seriously but do they really?  I have a glass company that was attacked by someone I have never done business with and provided a false off topic one line review saying they don’t come to your location. Has anyone ever encountered a glass company that doesn't offer on-site services? That would be akin to a lawn care, plumbing, or electrical service that doesn't visit customers. We are, after all, a service-oriented business. We clearly indicate our service area on Google Maps. While it may be challenging to demonstrate that we weren't contacted, we can easily prove that we travel to our clients' locations. It would be impossible for us to install a shower door at your residence without actually going there. Similarly, our emergency board-up service would be ineffective if we advised customers to bring their storefronts to us after an accident.  It will not allow me to appeal it again and replying back may help if people read the reply.  A single 1 star review by someone who may or may not have contacted us leaving inaccurate information is a recipe for disaster considering it easily could have been a competitor or someone who has a personal problem with me or a employee.  I wish Google would take matters seriously like they say they do.  I would give Google 1 star review for posting false information in the guidelines, the response time, and the lack of information in the reply they sent to me.",

          "text": "In my opinion Google Maps is not a reliable source for information about a business. Here is my reasoning.  I tried to get a false review removed and then not hearing back for weeks I tried appealing using the tools provided just to get a denial with no explanation except it doesn’t violate the guidelines but in reality the false review obviously did as I pointed out using the information from the guidelines.  It is disheartening and it is  disappointing that Google does not adhere to the guidelines they've established. At this point, my trust in Google's reliability has diminished. It's unsettling that such an apparent discrepancy like this is not being removed when it clearly should be, exists. They say that they take it seriously but do they really?  I have a glass company that was attacked by someone I have never done business with and provided a false off topic one line review saying they don’t come to your location. Has anyone ever encountered a glass company that doesn't offer on-site services? That would be akin to a lawn care, plumbing, or electrical service that doesn't visit customers. We are, after all, a service-oriented business. We clearly indicate our service area on Google Maps. While it may be challenging to demonstrate that we weren't contacted, we can easily prove that we travel to our clients' locations. It would be impossible for us to install a shower door at your residence without actually going there. Similarly, our emergency board-up service would be ineffective if we advised customers to bring their storefronts to us after an accident.  It will not allow me to appeal it again and replying back may help if people read the reply.  A single 1 star review by someone who may or may not have contacted us leaving inaccurate information is a recipe for disaster considering it easily could have been a competitor or someone who has a personal problem with me or a employee.  I wish Google would take matters seriously like they say they do.  I would give Google 1 star review for posting false information in the guidelines, the response time, and the lack of information in the reply they sent to me.",
