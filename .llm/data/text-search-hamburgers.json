Prices are very good for Hamburg's standards (where sometimes you pay astronomical prices for a small burger...), We paid 18 euros per person, and we ordered beer, fries and a big burger, so a very good price.\n\nThe place itself is very cute too, nice tables and comfy chairs.

              "text": "I went here with my family and it was great. Amazing, tasty burgers with big portions and local produce, they don't feel \"industrial\" at all!\n\nThe staff was super friendly, one of the waiters asked us some questions and joked with us and she was super nice, service was fast and overall everything was great, the atmosphere felt cosy and friendly as well, I'd definitely come back here again.\n\nVegetarian options are endless, all burgers are veg by default, but you can switch to beef. Prices are very good for Hamburg's standards (where sometimes you pay astronomical prices for a small burger...), We paid 18 euros per person, and we ordered beer, fries and a big burger, so a very good price.\n\nThe place itself is very cute too, nice tables and comfy chairs. Overall, a great experience, totally recommend this place!",

              "text": "Hamburg is a city whose very name is linked to the word \"Hamburger\", and as one might expect, there are numerous good burger establishments throughout the city. Amongst these, I recently visited Peter Pane, a restaurant that provides a rather satisfying experience.\n\nWhat makes Peter Pane stand out is a combination of elements: the food is genuinely tasty, the restaurant itself is clean and well-kept, and the interior design is also quite appealing, creating a pleasant dining atmosphere.\n\nThe restaurant space appears to be quite large, which often means that whilst making a reservation might not always be strictly necessary, there is usually ample seating available. Upon ordering drinks, they are prepared freshly at the central bar area and then brought directly to your table.\n\nTurning to the food, the burger patties are particularly noteworthy. They possess a good, rich meaty flavour that comes through well. The accompanying chips (fries) are also prepared excellently – achieving that desirable crispness on the outside whilst remaining tender in the middle. Their appealing golden brown colour suggests they have been fried at just the right temperature. The overall balance of flavours in the meal feels well-judged and harmonious.\n\nIf you are in Hamburg and looking for a high-quality burger experience that lives up to the city's historical association with the dish, visiting Peter Pane would be a good choice.",

              "text": "Hamburg is a city whose very name is linked to the word \"Hamburger\", and as one might expect, there are numerous good burger establishments throughout the city. Amongst these, I recently visited Peter Pane, a restaurant that provides a rather satisfying experience.\n\nWhat makes Peter Pane stand out is a combination of elements: the food is genuinely tasty, the restaurant itself is clean and well-kept, and the interior design is also quite appealing, creating a pleasant dining atmosphere.\n\nThe restaurant space appears to be quite large, which often means that whilst making a reservation might not always be strictly necessary, there is usually ample seating available. Upon ordering drinks, they are prepared freshly at the central bar area and then brought directly to your table.\n\nTurning to the food, the burger patties are particularly noteworthy. They possess a good, rich meaty flavour that comes through well. The accompanying chips (fries) are also prepared excellently – achieving that desirable crispness on the outside whilst remaining tender in the middle. Their appealing golden brown colour suggests they have been fried at just the right temperature. The overall balance of flavours in the meal feels well-judged and harmonious.\n\nIf you are in Hamburg and looking for a high-quality burger experience that lives up to the city's historical association with the dish, visiting Peter Pane would be a good choice.",

Working in Hamburg for a couple of weeks and while wandering around the town I found a place called Peter Pane that looked pretty well put-together so I checked it out! Little did I know it was a chain of restaurants consisting of more than 55 locations around Europe. Lol. Do I even need to leave a review for a place that is that successful? Might as well! Here goes.\n\nAtmosphere/Appearance: From the outside you can kinda see the grandness of what there is to behold inside, but once through the doors I was BLOWN AWAY. The ceilings were high, the decor was FABULOUS! Like, I was transported to like, a jungle or something! Big, tall trees, benches, a big bar directly in the middle of the restaurant and such good energy in here!\n\nService: I can't remember who took care of us either time we went, but I can't remember having a problem with service at all.\n\nFood: So this place focuses mainly on its diverse burger varieties! They offer smash burgers, chicken burgers, vegetarian burgers, bunless burgers, fries and various salads. On my first visit I tried the Don Dattel which was a 150g burger patty, bacon, date cream, greens, red jalapenos and a smoked white sauce. It was pretty good! Nothing crazy to shout from the Heavens about, but I enjoyed it. I also tried the truffle fries and I LOVED those. I can tell it was a truffle oil that was used because of how pungent the odor was, but I didn't mind. Lol. I honestly don't remember what burger I had on the 2nd visit, so it must not have been memorable. The sweet potato fries were okay as well.\n\nValue: It's a burger joint, so your wallet should feel very safe here.\n\nIn conclusion, this place was cool. If you'd like something safe, check out a Peter Pane near you, but... I always am about supporting a local business just trying to make it.",

The sides were fresh and well-seasoned, and everything came out quickly despite how busy the restaurant was. The location is great, right by Jungfernstieg, with a nice atmosphere and clean space.\n\nThe service was exceptional. The staff was friendly, attentive, and made us feel very welcome. They checked on our table regularly without being intrusive, and everything was served with a smile.\n\nOverall, a great dining experience and definitely one of the best steak restaurants in Hamburg. Highly recommended — I will absolutely be back! 🥩✨",
